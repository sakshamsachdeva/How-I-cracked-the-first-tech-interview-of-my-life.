# How-I-cracked-the-first-tech-interview-of-my-life.

Here I am sharing my personal experience which I gathered from vaious online communites and smart fellows. It hepled me in cracking the first technical round of my life of a `Fortune 500 MNC` followed by a job offer. I am going to share the roadmap that I followed. Also all of this is relevant only for MNCs and startups other than The Big Five i.e. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Googleâ€™s parent company Alphabet.

I statred my preparation 6 months before the beginning of placement session of my college. I advise you to start as early as possible because at the end the job is what that matters.



- There are four major rounds in any placement drive :
   - Aptitude Round
   
   - Coding Round
   
   - Face-to-Face Technical Round
   
   - HR Round
   
   Chronology me differ from company to company, some take HR round before technical.
   
   Also, some MNCs take Chief Technical Officer round (CTO) after all of the above rounds.
   
   
   # Cracking the coding interview
     It's a gem, written by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell. Right before starting your interview preparation, you should go through the introduction of this book, that covers,
     - The Interview Process .
     - Behind the Scenes 
     - Special Situations 
     - Before the Interview
     - Behavioral Questions
     - Big O
     - Technical Questions
     - The Offer and Beyond 
     
   Now, 
   
   # Aptitude Round
   Many students stuck in this round. Even if you have excellent coding skills but firstly you have to go through this screnning round. Many coding geeks face problems when a scrennig round act as an obstacle and stop them from showing their skills. I am sharing a list of topics which should be covered for this round.
   
  - Problems on Trains
  
  - Height and Distance
  
  - Simple Interest

  - Profit and Loss

  - Percentage

  - Calendar

  - Average

  - Volume and Surface Area

  - Numbers

  - Problems on H.C.F and L.C.M

  - Simplification

  - Surds and Indices

  - Boats and Streams

  - Logarithm

  - Odd Man Out and Series

  - Time and Distance

  - Time and Work

  - Compound Interest

  - Partnership

  - Problems on Ages

  - Clock

  - Area

  - Permutation and Combination
 
  - Problems on Numbers

  - Decimal Fraction
 
  - Square Root and Cube Root
 
  - Ratio and Proportion

  - Pipes and Cistern

  - Alligation or Mixture

  - Probability

Obviously we are in Btech/MCA we can easily solve these problems. But, WAIT , We just not only have to solve these questions but also within stipulated time. You have to improve your speed, and, for that, learn tricks/shortcuts to solve a particular type of problem. I am sharing a youtube channel for tricks : [SSC ADDA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAyYBPzFioHUxvVZEn4rMJA
)     but there are many others which can be followed.

Now, you know shortcuts, your speed is improved , it's time to practice.

   # Coding Round  
   
   - The magic of C & C++ :
     - Firstly, you should know the languages C & C++. Although there are many advanced programming languages in the market , but, C and C++ are the basics. Many interviewers expect this and can ask concepts in face-to-face interview rounds or output based questions even in the aptitute round.

      - Practice output based questions on C from : [GeeksforGeeks : C Multiple Choice Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-multiple-choice-questions/)
      - and C++ from : [GeeksforGeeks : C++ Multiple Choice Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-multiple-choice-questions/)

   - The Data Structures & Algorithms :
       - DSA is the base of coding round. You should have good grasp on this. Concepts can be cleared from the book 
           "Data Structures and Algorithms" by Narashimha Karumanchi
       - Practice MCQ's on DSA from [GeeksforGeeks : DSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structure-gq/)   
  Now, when you know DSA It's time to practice as much as possible. Spare 1-2 hours daily for this, no matter what.
  
  - Online Coding Platforms :
    - There are many websites for practicing coding questions like HackerRank, Codechef, LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerEarth, CodeForces etc. But, you don't need to follow all of these sites, Only one will be more than enough. Now, the question arises which site to choose ? These coding platforms are divided into two parts : 
       - Competitive Programming - HackerRank, Codechef, HackerEarth, CodeForces 
       - Interview Specific Programming - GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode
       
     - Competitive programming is like a sport for coding geeks. You may opt for this if you have a lot of time. But, if your placement    session is just 5-6 months ahead, the Interview specific programming  should be done, as it contains the exact or similar questions that can be asked in your coding round. 
      - You can choose any programming language of your choice for this round.
      - Practice 40-50 questions on each data structure like array, string, linked list, stack, queue, binary tree etc.
          
  
  # Face-to-Face Technical Round
   - This round is really unpredictable and depends on company and moreover a particular interview panel.
   - Majority of questions are asked from the language of your choice, DBMS, SQL Queries and the projects that you have done.
   - Computer Organistaion & Networking questions can also be asked but are rare. You cannot skip these.
   
      I can provide resources for Java. You may opt any language for this round.
   
      - Study concepts of Java from : [JavaTpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial)
      - 300 Java Interview Questions : [JavaTpoint : 300 questions](https://www.javatpoint.com/corejava-interview-questions)
      - MCQ's on Java : [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-multiple-choice-questions/) 
      - Concepts of DBMS from : [StudyTonight : DBMS](https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/)
      - Practice SQL Queries from : [GeeksforGeeks : SQL Queries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-tutorial/) 
     
   - Also you should know each and everything about the projects that you are mentioning in your resume ( or atleast the module you have implemented in case of group project).
