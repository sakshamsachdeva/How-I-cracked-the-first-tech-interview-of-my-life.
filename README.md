# How-I-cracked-the-first-tech-interview-of-my-life.

Here I am sharing my personal experience which I gathered from vaious online communites and smart fellows. It hepled me in cracking the first technical round of my life of a `Fortune 500 MNC` followed by a job offer. I am going to share the roadmap that I followed. Also all of this is relevant only for MNCs and startups other than The Big Five i.e. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Googleâ€™s parent company Alphabet.

I statred my preparation 6 months before the beginning of placement session of my college. I advise you to start as early as possible because at the end the job is what that matters.



- There are four major rounds in any placement drive :
   - Aptitude Round
   
   - Coding Round
   
   - Face-to-Face Technical Round
   
   - HR Round
   
   Chronology me differ from company to company, some take HR round before technical.
   
   Also, some MNCs take Chief Technical Officer round (CTO) after all of the above rounds.
   
   
   Now,

Obviously we are in Btech/MCA we can easily solve these problems. But, WAIT , We just not only have to solve these questions but also within stipulated time. You have to improve your speed, and, for that, learn tricks/shortcuts to solve a particular type of problem. I am sharing a youtube channel for tricks : [SSC ADDA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAyYBPzFioHUxvVZEn4rMJA
)     but there are many others which can be followed.

Now, you know shortcuts, your speed is improved , it's time to practice.
